## FAQ

#### Why did you build this?

I wanted to build a full stack production-level application in order to 
prove my skills in software development. The app this was inspired by
is something I use quite frequently, so I decided to emulate
the experience with my own code. 

#### How long did this take?

The project is still under development, but it's expected to be complete
1-3 months from the initial designs.
